# 🧠 LangGraph Workflows – Sequential & Parallel Implementations

This repository contains hands-on projects using **LangGraph**, demonstrating how to build structured LLM applications with **stateful workflows, branching logic, parallel function execution, memory, and agents**.  

It’s designed for developers and enthusiasts to learn LangGraph through practical examples.

## 🚀 Project Files Overview

| File / Folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `1_sequential_graph.ipynb` | A Jupyter notebook demonstrating a **simple sequential workflow** using LangGraph. It shows how to define a state, create a node function calling an LLM (HuggingFace API), add nodes and edges to a graph, and execute the workflow to get the final result. |
| `parallel_graph/` | Placeholder folder for future **parallel workflow examples** where multiple nodes can run simultaneously. |
| `workflow_examples/` | Placeholder for **real-world workflows** integrating LLM calls, tools, prompts, and memory. |
| `state_management/` | Placeholder for examples of **TypedDict state objects and passing state between nodes**. |
| `agents/` | Placeholder for **multi-agent collaboration examples**. |
| `memory/` | Placeholder for examples of **persistent memory and conversation history**. |
